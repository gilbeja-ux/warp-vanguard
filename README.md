# Warp Overwatch: Lane Vanguards

A mobile game for iOS and Android featuring dual-node controls in a fiber-optic tunnel defense gameplay.

## About

Pilot a payload through a data tunnel by commanding two radial nodes to intercept incoming data traps. Features:
- Dual-thumb radial dial controls with a guided first-run tutorial
- 8-level campaign: heavy traps, barrier lines, burst volleys, speed waves,
  color-locked traps, and a firewall-core boss fight
- Endless mode with time-ramped difficulty and best-score tracking
- Power-ups riding the stream: slow-mo, wide-arc, auto-zap
- Custom soundtrack with seamless Web Audio looping
- Haptics, auto-pause on app switch, safe-area aware UI, perf watchdog
- Offline-capable gameplay
- Cross-platform (iOS & Android)

Run the test suite with `npm test` (headless DOM-stubbed harness that drives
the real game code).
